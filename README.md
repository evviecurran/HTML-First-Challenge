## Creating a website where readability is the main point. 

The main point of this project was to make the website readable for all. It was important to ensure all individuals that visit the website are able to read it or have it read to them in proper order. 

Through this solution it provides a website name and ensures there is cascading headers since it carries more weight which improves the readability

Through this work I was able to comphrehend how to format a website where it is accessible to all 

This project informed how I am able to create something for all. This ensures in the future my ability to provide this to users.
